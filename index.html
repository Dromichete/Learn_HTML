            <p>Literature is any collection of written work, but it is also used more narrowly for writings specifically considered to be an art form, <br/>
                especially novels, plays, and poems. It includes both print and digital writing. In recent centuries, the definition has expanded to include oral literature,<br/>
                 much of which has been transcribed. Literature is a method of recording, preserving, and transmitting knowledge and entertainment. <br/>
                 It can also have a social, psychological, spiritual, or political role.</p>
